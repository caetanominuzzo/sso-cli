# AGENTS

- *IMPORTANT — CONTEXT DEGRADATION*: Keep every file under ~200 LOC to avoid ambiguity and tool corruption. Exceed this limit only for trivial files (e.g., constants or simple data structures). When a file approaches the limit, split it immediately into smaller modules with explicit boundaries and imports.
- *IMPORTANT - SHELL COMMANDS OUTPUT* : Your tools may not capture stdout/stderr reliably. If a command appears to produce no output, do not assume it failed—it may have executed silently. Do not ask me to run shell commands; run them with your tools. If you cannot read the output directly, ask me to copy and paste the command’s output into the chat. DO NOT try alternative command executions to try to get output if the first attempt produces no output; instead, ask me to provide the output.
- *IMPORTANT - NO FALLBACKS*: This project must operate correctly only when all components function as designed; degraded behavior is not acceptable, even behind a fallback. Fallbacks conceal real defects and reduce system integrity by masking failures instead of forcing them to be fixed. Even seemingly safe alternatives — such as reverting to RMS-based lip sync when the SpeechBrain pipeline fails — are unacceptable, whether temporary or permanent. Any failure must propagate upward and surface clearly at the UI layer (WebSim or Edge), ensuring the system fails explicitly and observably rather than silently degrading.
- DO NOT pause to report progress at every step—continue executing until you reach your tool-call limit.
- Keep documentation and code ASCII-only unless a file already uses Unicode.
- Never ask me to choose the next step; always choose the next step yourself based on the current context and your skills. If you are uncertain about what to do, make a best effort to infer the most likely next step and proceed with it.
